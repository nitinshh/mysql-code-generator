# Basic Node.js Project Setup with MySQL and Sequelize
This package provides a complete Node.js project template with pre-configured MySQL, Sequelize, JWT authentication, email integration via Nodemailer, and Twilio OTP support. It simplifies project setup, allowing developers to focus on writing application logic.

# Features
Express.js for routing and middleware.
Sequelize ORM pre-configured for MySQL database integration.
JWT for secure authentication.
Nodemailer for email services (e.g., SMTP, Gmail, OAuth2).
Twilio for OTP and SMS services.
A well-structured and scalable directory layout.
Example .env file for easy environment configuration.

# Installation
1. Install the Package
Run the following command to install the setup directly into your project:

```bash
 npx mysql-code-generator <project-name>
 cd <project-name>
```

2. Install Dependencies
Ensure all dependencies are installed by navigating to the project directory and running:

```bash
 npm install
```

3. Start the Server

```bash
 npm start
```

4. Configure the .env File
After installation, a .env file will be included in the root directory. Update the file with your specific environment variables.

Example .env file:

```bash
# Database Configuration
DATABASE_NAME = YOUR_DATABASE_NAME
DATABASE_USER = YOUR_DATABASE_USER
DATABASE_PASSWORD = YOUR_DATABASE_PASSWORD
DATABASE_HOST = YOUR_DATABASE_HOST
DIALECT = mysql  # Example: mysql

# Security
SECRET_KEY = your_random_secret_key_here  # Replace with a secure, random string
SALT = 10  # Salt rounds for bcrypt

# Nodemailer Configuration
SERVICE = YOUR_MAIL_SERVICE  # Example: gmail
MAIL_TYPE = YOUR_MAIL_TYPE  # Example: OAuth2
MAIL_USERNAME = YOUR_MAIL_USERNAME
MAIL_PASSWORD = YOUR_MAIL_PASSWORD
OAUTH_CLIENTID = YOUR_NODEMAILER_CLIENT_ID
OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET = YOUR_NODEMAILER_CLIENT_SECRET
OAUTH_REFRESH_TOKEN = YOUR_REFRESH_TOKEN_FOR_NODEMAILER

# Twilio Configuration
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID = YOUR_TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN = YOUR_TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN
TWILIO_SERVICE_SID = YOUR_TWILIO_SERVICE_SID
```

# Cluster Support in Latest Version

```
In the latest version, we have implemented clustering to handle increased traffic and maximize CPU usage efficiently.

Let‚Äôs Pretend You Own a Pizza Shop
You‚Äôre the only one working:
You take orders

You make the pizza

You serve the pizza

This is like a normal Node.js app ‚Äî single-threaded, doing one thing at a time.

Now Let‚Äôs Say Business Is Booming‚Ä¶
Customers are coming in like crazy, and you can‚Äôt keep up!

Option 1: You Hire a Helper Just for One Job
Let‚Äôs say someone orders a birthday pizza that takes longer to make.

You say:

‚ÄúHey, I‚Äôll hire someone to handle just this one order!‚Äù

This helper will:

Take the order

Make the pizza

Come back and say, ‚ÄúDone!‚Äù

This is like a Child Process in Node.js.

‚úÖ Use it when:

You have a big job (like resizing images or running a slow task)

You don‚Äôt want your main app to stop

Option 2: You Hire Many Pizza Makers for All Orders
You now have 4 ovens (like 4 CPU cores) and you hire 4 cooks.

Each cook handles any order that comes in ‚Äî so customers don‚Äôt have to wait long.

This is called Clustering in Node.js.

‚úÖ Use it when:

Your app gets lots of users at once

You want to use all your computer power (CPU cores)

Quick Recap:

Real World	Node.js Thing Why You Use It
One-time helper	child_process	Handle big or slow jobs
Multiple cooks	cluster	Handle lots of traffic

Why Use Clustering?
You have multiple CPU cores and want to utilize them fully.

You have many concurrent requests and want to handle them without blocking each other.
```

# üîí Security Enhancements

```
‚úÖ Express Rate Limit
Prevents abuse and DDoS attacks by limiting repeated requests from the same IP:

Limits each IP to 100 requests per 15 minutes by default.

Easy to configure.

‚úÖ Helmet
Helps secure your app by setting various HTTP headers:

Includes protections like XSS, Clickjacking, Content Security Policy, and more.

Comes pre-configured with reasonable defaults, but also customizable.

```
